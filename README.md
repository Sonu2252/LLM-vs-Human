An AI model that is trained to generate new data samples that tries to resemble given set of training samples. Genrative models are used for image generation, Natural Language Processing, data augmnetation and many more. Here, in Large Language Model System, we use the same principle to generate the text related to the training samples. The main downside of generative model is low variability distribution mean. For this we exploit this low variability distribution mean and find out the difference between the AI generated text and student written text. A low variance will have values grouped around the mean (e.g. a narrow bell shape), whereas a high vaiance will have values spread out from the norm.
